Write in your own words: this is the course's instruction text.

## 1. The goal

One or two sentences: the course's prompt.

<!-- STUDENT week=2 part=home id=design-02-goal "Say what this part does" -->
<!-- TODO(week 2, design-02-goal): Say what this part does -->
The bus is how every part talks, one tick at a time.
<!-- END -->

## 6. The board

<!-- STUDENT week=2 part=home id=design-02-board "Photograph your sketch" -->
<!-- @stub ![My board sketch](week-02-board.jpg) -->
![My board sketch](week-02-board.png)

The bus is a lane across the middle.
<!-- END -->

## 7. Decisions

<!-- STUDENT week=2 part=home id=design-02-decisions "Fill in the table" -->
| Decision | What I chose | What I didn't, and why |
|---|---|---|
| Memory layout | a 32 × 32 grid | one long row: it won't fit |
| | | |
<!-- END -->

## 8. Questions I still have

<!-- STUDENT week=2 part=home id=design-02-questions "What are you unsure about" -->
- What should the board show when a request faults?
<!-- END -->

## 9. Agent brief

<!-- STUDENT week=2 part=home id=design-02-brief "Fill in the brief" -->
| Line | Text |
|---|---|
| | |
<!-- END -->
