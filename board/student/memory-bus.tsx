// Week 3: draw memory and the bus, with packets travelling between the parts.
// The feed (board/feed) gives you one Frame per tick: `frame.packets` are the messages that
// tick carried and `frame.accesses` the memory reads and writes. Draw them your way; the
// week-3 tests only check the two functions at the top.
